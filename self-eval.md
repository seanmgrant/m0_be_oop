# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I'm not sure I fully understand it. But I gave it my best


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
today my focus was good but I didn't take any breaks because I was catching up.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need? I definitely need someone to run my thought through,
